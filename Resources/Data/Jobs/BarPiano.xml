            Her playing is really good and gets praised by the customers often.
            <Text>Her playing was pleasing, if bland.  Her rhythm was nice, if slightly untrained.</Text>
            <Text>${name} doesn't have any trouble playing the piano.</Text>

            She almost never hits a right note. Lucky for you most of the customers are too drunk and horny to care.
            <Text>She is terrible at this. Some customers left after she started to play.</Text>
            <Text>You could count on the fingers of one hand the part in her performance that was clean.</Text>
            <Text>She is bad at playing the piano.</Text>
            <Text>${name} knows a note. Too bad it's the only one she knows and plays it over and over.</Text>

                Her playing is barely acceptable,

            She didn't play the piano so much as banged on it.

                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a piano was capable of making such noise.

                After ten seconds you wanted to grab an axe and end the instrument's misery under ${name}'s
                attempt to play.

            <Text>Nobody else would call this random key-mashing 'playing', but ${name} thinks otherwise.</Text>
            <Text>When ${name} started to play, the bar emptied almost instantly. This could be useful in a fire.</Text>
