            <Text>${name} quickly striped off her clothes, acting like this was her times being processed at the jail.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Clumsy|Dojikko">
                ${name} began to take off her clothes slowly. Not because she was particularly sensual about it, it just
                took her three tries to open her bra. "Cut!" comes the instruction from the director. "Let's try this again."

                This time, everything seems to go smoothly, until her heels get entangled in her panties and she falls over.
                The director sighs, looking at ${name}'s bloody nose. "I guess we need to work with the footage we have now."

            <Text>${name} is the worst stripper you have EVER seen. Way to shy to even look up and she blushed the entire remakes.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Chaste|Shy|Nervous">
                ${name} looks so uncomfortable when the director orders her to take her clothes off that you imagine
                even blind people would be turned off by this scene.

                At the end of the filming, the director looks at you apologetically. "I've tried", she says, "but
                I think ${name} is just too ugly for this"
