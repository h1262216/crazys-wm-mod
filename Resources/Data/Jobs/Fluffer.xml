                She was so skillful in keeping the actors aroused that your camera mage decided to film some of her work
                too. This will be a great after-credits shot.

                Who needs blue pills and aphrodisiacs when you have ${name}. She is great at keeping the actors ready to
                work.

                She is supposed to keep the actors aroused, but her attempts left them amused at best.

                Her performance on set has earned her the nickname "The Limper". This has nothing to do with the way she
                walks.
