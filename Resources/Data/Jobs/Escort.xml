                ${name} has been assigned to work as an Escort. She is informed that various men will ask for her to accompany them on dates,
                whether because they need a date for a social engagement of some kind or because of their own loneliness.
                Her skills in service, her beauty, her charisma, her intelligence, and her refinement may all be tested to provide the ideal date that each client requests.
                And, of course, should she decide to spend some \"extra\" time with the client, she will need to perform well with each of their sexual proclivities.
                This is her choice, however.

                ${name} is deaf, meaning she would be unable to hear the conversation that is so critical to being successful as an escort.
                As there is practically no chance that a client will want to have an entire date in sign language, assuming he even knows it,
                ${name} is particularly unsuited to work as an escort. You should consider alternate employment for her. Nobody chooses her this week.

                She read the biography that your escort clients are obligated to provide,

                The wife moves uncomfortably in her seat as this moment draws out longer.

                What neither the boss nor the client see, however, is the long interested stare that the wife gives her.

                This conversation would have gone better in one respect:
                if ${name} were not such a dominant girl,
                she would have wisely allowed the client to lead the conversation,
                as it is ultimately his relationship with his own boss that is ultimately most important.
                Her constant interjections and attempts to steer the conversation where
                she wants it to go did give the impression that the client had picked
                a particularly chatty girl with some difficulty at understanding social cues.

                The conversation would have gone better if ${name} had not started shooting the sake as fast as it was delivered.
                Her alcoholism managed to capture everyone's attention,
                and the boss and his wife did share one silent concerned look with the client as ${name} started her fifth bottle.

            <Text Condition="Social Drinker" Updates="Escort+=1">
                The sake flowed freely throughout the dinner, and ${name}, being a social drinker,
                energetically convinces all three others to keep pace with her.
                They all start enjoying themselves with the social lubricant in no time,
                and the dinner party took a more jovial tone than any of them had expected.

            <Text Condition="Porn Star" Updates="Escort+=1">
                Throughout the dinner, ${name} did notice the boss occasionally staring at her with curiosity.
                "I could swear I've seen you before somewhere," he muttered, unable to put his finger on it,
                but somehow all the more interested in her.
                ${name} suspects that her work as a porn star may mean that he certainly has seen her before,
                and he has probably seen a lot of other people putting their fingers, and other body parts on "it," too.

                ${name} is finely attuned to the sexual signals of both men and women, since she is attracted to both,
                and she can easily detect the vibes that the boss's wife is giving.
                They are both looking her over with more than casual interest,
                and this gives ${name} some interesting ideas.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Lesbian" Updates="Escort+=1">
                ${name} may escort men for a living, but her real romantic interest is with other women.
                Consequently, she detects a certain vibe coming from the boss's wife throughout the dinner that she recognizes pretty quickly.
                The two of them share some lingering looks that the men do not see or understand,
                but they know that there is the potential for something here tonight.

                The four of them are laughing like old friends by the time the bill arrives,
                and ${name} can feel looks of attraction and lust coming her way from the client,
                which is expected, and from the boss, which is a nice bonus.
                She can also feel them coming from the boss's wife, which was something she had not expected this evening,
                but the looks were strong enough that she was not completely surprised when the wife looked knowingly at her husband and whispered something in his ear.
                He smiles for a second and then looks at his new employee and ${name}.
                "I know this may be a bit unorthodox," he begins,
                "but we've been having a great evening, and we wanted to know if... maybe... the two of you wanted to keep the night going at our place?"
                The client looks at ${name} with surprise and amazement, but then thinks about it and smiles.
                His look changes to that of an open question, meaning that he will take ${name}'s lead on the answer.

                As soon as one appears, he escorts ${name} quickly out of the restaurant.
                "I can't believe that worked," he says, nervously, "but it almost didn't.
                Thanks, but let's just call it a night. Take your fee," he whispers,
                discreetly handing her an envelope with her payment.
                "I'll tell them you had a work thing tonight and go chat some more. Thanks,"

                The dinner ends with the boss and his wife sharing a skeptical glance as the client hurries ${name} out the door to an imaginary late-night work assignment.
                "That was absolutely terrible,"
                he whispers ferociously to her when they are alone outside.
                "Now I have to go back in and do damage control. For all I know, you may have just cost me my job.
                Maybe that's my fault for taking this risk with you, but I can definitely tell you one thing:
                I will not be paying for this. Tell your boss that he needs to be much more careful with his assignments in the future."
                He turns angrily on his heels, composes himself, and reenters the restaurant,
                leaving ${name} to walk back to your establishment, asking herself about the myriad things she did wrong.

                ${name} is savvy enough to know what they are suggesting,
                but is too conservative in her morals to consider having sex with all of them.
                She politely declines, much to the client's regret, but tells them that she did have a wonderful evening.
                The client escorts her outside, and thanks her for her incredible performance.
                "I know that the group offer might not be your thing," he says,
                "but I thought maybe you and I might keep our little fake relationship going for another hour or two,

                ${name} politely considers the offer, but the fact of the matter is that she has no interest in sex with anyone tonight.
                She invents an excuse about having a work event to get to, apologizing profusely,
                but suggesting that maybe the four of them grab another dinner sometime soon.
                The client is surprised at the suggestion, since it means that he may have to pay for another group date with his "girlfriend,"
                but he is hardly angry, as the possibility of fucking his boss's wife is a bit too enticing for him to ignore.
                The client escorts her outside and discreetly hands her an envelope with a substantial tip for her excellent work tonight.

            ${name} smiles at the offer, and leans a bit over the table before answering. "I think we would love to join you," she says.
            They all grin with anticipation, getting up to leave.
            As they walk out the door, ${name} leaves the client's side for a moment to speak to the wife.
            "I think you should know," she whispers, "that I am still a virgin, and that the two of us have decided to wait until marriage."
            The wife appears disappointed, but livens as ${name} continues:
            "This doesn't mean that the two of us can't get to know each other a little better at your place, though.
            As long as the boys know that my body is off limits, I think we could still have a very enjoyable evening."
            The wife smiles and turns to whisper something to her husband while ${name} discreetly informs the client of the arrangement.
            He smiles as well, and the four of them soon arrive at a lovely expensive home,
            where they soon begin undressing themselves around a large bed.

            Within minutes, the wife has her lips wrapped around her husband's cock as the client spears her ass.
            She writhes in pleasure, pulling ${name}'s head towards her open pussy.

                she is screaming with passion on her fifth powerful orgasm, spraying her juices everywhere.

                You are so graceful and beautiful that you would probably never associate with a simple man like me, but you made me feel like royalty tonight,
                and I cannot thank you enough for that.
                Please accept this envelope with your fee and a substantial token of my esteem and affection."
                He pauses, gathering his courage before continuing.
                "And if you do not have other plans for the night, I would be forever grateful if you would join me at my home for coffee.
                I know that I'm probably not the kind of man you usually join,
                but maybe my respect and gratitude for you might let you look passed my.. well, my lack of refinement, I suppose."

                moaning with pleasure the whole time. She forces herself to take him deeply right before he cums,
                making herself gag on him but using her involuntary reflex as another way of massaging his shaft.
                He shoots a violent explosion of cum into her mouth and then staggers back,
                collapsing on his couch.
                "That was amazing," he pants as ${name} licks the cum from her lips.

                She gently begins licking his balls while wrapping her hand delicately over his shaft.
                After a few minutes of ball pleasuring, she begins licking his shaft with increased pressure,
                sucking on his tip passionately.
                She does not go deeper, aware that her gag reflex would cause problems,
                but is easily able to satisfy him with the licks and shallow sucking alone.
                Soon he builds to a powerful orgasm that floods her mouth after a few more minutes of her expert technique.

                says ${name} as she falls to her knees and pulls his cock out from his pants.
                She lovingly licks every part of his crotch,
                teasing his balls with her tongue and then engulfing his tip with her mouth as she rotates her tongue around the head.
                She avoids going any deeper out of concern for her gag reflex, which ultimately results in a mediocre blowjob,
                but the client is soon shooting semen until it leaks out of the sides of her mouth.

                The client groans with pleasure, and ${name} keeps sucking the tip of his cock.
                And keeps sucking. For minutes. She does not vary her technique, or move to lick or suck anything else,
                or take the cock deeper into her mouth.
                She simply sucks as if it is a nipple and she is waiting for milk to come out,
                which the client supposes is not too far from the truth. Still, it is not a great blowjob,
                and it is not until he takes over and starts thrusting himself into her that he is able to build towards orgasm.
                ${name}'s gag reflex suddenly kicks in, though, which is probably why she was staying so shallow on the tip in the first place,
                and she is soon coughing all over his cock and pulling herself away to recover.
                This kills the mood for a period,
                and it is not until she regains composure and the client masturbates himself into her mouth that he is able to cum.
                The whole experience leaves him slightly disappointed.

                He sighs with satisfaction and prepares to enjoy the blowjob until he realizes that she has absolutely no idea what she is doing.
                She licks the cock like it is a lollipop, with the skill of a virgin and the enthusiasm of a dog going after peanut butter.
                Disaster strikes, however, when she tries to swallow his cock into her throat and her pronounced gag reflex kicked in.
                The gagging, combined with the alcohol from the bar, triggers instant and projectile vomit all over the client's cock.
                "Oh no!" cries ${name}  as she recovers from her retching, staring in horror at the client,
                who is silently gazing at the pile of puke covering him.
                "I'm so sorry! I'm so so so sorry," she continues looking around for something to wipe it all up.
                After a few minutes of mopping the vomit from his crotch, ${name} awkwardly pulls her clothes together and prepares to leave,
                painfully aware that the client will not be getting another erection any time soon.
                "I'm so embarrassed," she whimpers as she moves for the door.
