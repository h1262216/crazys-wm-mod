                Her skill with movie crystals, together with her deep understanding of colour and contrast allowed
                her to transform the scene into a masterpiece. Truly an outstanding work in post-production.

                She preserves the recordings with great skill, and is able to perform some touch-ups that make the
                scenes look even better.

                She knows how to preserve the recording, and has the skill to edit them further in post-production.
                What ${name} is lacking is the experience on where to edit and how to touch up things in a more subtle
                way.

                She managed to preserve the recording more or less in the same state as the original film.

                She managed to preserve the recordings in a storage crystal, though the image is somewhat distorted
                in places.

                Seeing the cracked movie crystal, you decide that ${name} probably should never again be left
                unsupervised with the footage. It is a wonder that there is still something left of the scene.
