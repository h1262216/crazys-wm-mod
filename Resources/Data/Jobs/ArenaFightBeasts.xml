                ${name} proved no match for this vicious beast!
                You send your men in to cage it.
                In their attempt to get to her before it's too late, they kill the beast, but not before it mortally
                wounds ${name}. They can only watch helplessly as she coughs up blood with her last breaths.

                If you'd had a Medic on standby, you might have been able to save her.

                As it becomes clear that it is about to kill her, your men manage to distract it long enough for a
                Medic to get to her.

                The bloody mess your goons carry out of the arena floor barely resembles a human being, but her shallow
                breaths indicate that she is still alive.
