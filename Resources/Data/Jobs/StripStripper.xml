                ${name} dragged one of the less sober clients outside into a back alley and ordered him to fuck her senseless against a wall.
                After the deed, the poor fellow passed out and ${name} returned to her job as if nothing happened.

                ${name} spotted a relatively good-looking guy walking into the bathroom alone.
                She followed him inside, and as he tried to exit the bathroom stall, he got pushed back in by her.
                ${name} didn't waste any time and in a matter of seconds was vigorously fucking the client.
                After the deed, the client made sure ${name} had a pretty hefty wad of money stuck behind her skirt.

            She must be the perfect stripper - customers go on and on about her and always come to see her when she works.

            <Text>${name} throws her bra into the crowd causing a fight to erupt over who got to take it home. They just love her.</Text>
            <Text>${name} use of the pole amazes the patrons. They truly have no idea how she does the things she does.</Text>
            <Text>People push and shove to get to the front of the stage for ${name}'s dance set.</Text>
            <Text>Somehow, ${name} managed to be so sexy that you thought you might need to close just to clean up the mess the crowd made.</Text>
            <Text Updates="Tips+=15">
                ${name}'s smile is enough to bring in the tips. You sometimes wonder if she even needs to take her clothes off.

            She's unbelievable at this and is always getting praised by the customers for her work.

            <Text>${name} throws her bra into the crowd causing an uproar of hooting and screaming. She knows how to drive them crazy.</Text>
            <Text>${name} draws just as many females as males to the club when it's her shift. It seems everyone has noticed her skill.</Text>
            <Text>All male members of ${name}'s audience had trouble standing after she finished her set.</Text>
            <Text>From start to finish, every move ${name} makes practically sweats sexuality.</Text>

            <Text>Since you let ${name} choose the music she dances to, her erotic dances have improved markedly.</Text>
            <Text>You watched with amusement as members of her audience made a disproportionate number of trips to the bathroom after her performance.</Text>

            She made a few mistakes but overall she is okay at this.

            <Text>While she won't win any contests, ${name} isn't a terrible stripper.</Text>
            <Text>${name} is not the best erotic dancer you've ever seen, but the drunks enjoy the eyecandy.</Text>

                ${name} spun around on the pole too much and got dizzy, causing her to fall off-stage buck-naked into the crowd.
                A lot of hands grabbed onto her and helped her back up... at least, that's what they said they were doing.
            </Text>
            <Text>${name}'s hair got tangled up in her shirt when she tried to take it off, making her reel about the stage like a drunk.</Text>
            <Text>For all the reaction she's getting, you could probably replace ${name} with a simple mannequin.</Text>
            <Text>${name} at least managed to get all her clothes off this time.</Text>
            <Text>${name} isn't qualified as a stripper, which might explain why she couldn't successfully detach her bra on stage.</Text>

            <Text>Somehow, ${name} forgot that she was a stripper and finished her set with her clothes still on.</Text>
            <Text>Somehow, ${name} managed to be so unsexy that the audience barely seemed to notice her presence.</Text>
