                Her singing is barely acceptable, but fortunately the bustling of the bar drowns ${name} out

            <Text>${name} singing was awful. Angry listeners throw random objects at her.</Text>

                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a human body could produce those sounds,
                much less call them "singing".
