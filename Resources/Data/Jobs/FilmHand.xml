            <Text>${name} expertly worked his cock and balls. She almost worshipped it!</Text>

                ${name} may have only one hand, but she sure knows how to use it.

            <Text>${name} enjoyed tickling him a bit while she gave a decent handjob.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Lesbian">
                ${name} is a decent actress, so despite her personal aversion, she managed to make a good handjob scene.

            <Text>${name} was ok with the handjob today. She almost wants to do other scenes.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Lesbian">
                ${name}'s handjob was ok, considering that she prefers pussy over cock.

        <Message Name="work.bad">
            <Text>${name} sucked doing the handjob, she was like a drone.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Lesbian">
                ${name} performed a very lacklustre handjob. Maybe it is because she herself has no interest in cock.

            <Text Condition="stat:Beauty>80|Great Figure|Hourglass Figure">
                The Director instructed the Camera Mage to focus more on her figure than on the action. But even with
                clever editing, the scene will be bad.

        <Message Name="work.worst">
            <Text>${name} was the worst actress the Director ever saw. She might be better at behind the scenes jobs.</Text>
            <Text Condition="Lesbian">
                With her dislike of $[cock][dick][penises] so clearly written on her face, ${name} really is unsuited for a handjob scene.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="One Arm|One Hand">
                One-handed ${name}'s attempts at a handjob succeeded in keeping you crew entertained, but will probably
                only make the blooper reel of your next movie.

                With those lips of hers, maybe you should have instructed her to to a blowjob scene.

            <Text Condition="Porn Star ^ Performance < 125" Chance="50">
                From a Porn Star as experienced as ${name} you would have expected better results.

                Even though it doesn't really show on film, ${name}'s costar swears that this was one of the best
                handjobs he's ever had.
