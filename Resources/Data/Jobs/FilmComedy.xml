                Throughout most of the movie she relied heavily on her large breasts for comedic relief;

                Her performance wasn't bad per se; however, there were noticeable flaws that made it far from perfect.
                There were occasional moments where she struggled with lines or forgot a key part of her character's personality,
                taking away from the overall effectiveness of each take.
                Nonetheless, despite these small hiccups here and there,
                she still brought plenty laughter out of audiences everywhere with her funny antics

                One day, during the filming of her big scene, she forgot all her lines
                and tried to improvise with some hilarious punchlines that left
                everyone on set rolling with laughter - except for the director who
                had no idea what was going through her mind!

                ${name}'s comedic timing was off, and she often missed cues or forgot lines during shooting.
                The end result was a very awkward performance that made everyone cringe at times.
                She tried hard but ultimately fell short of expectations in terms of quality.

                Her performance was awkward at best, consisting mostly of fumbling words, facial expressions, and clumsiness that made for an uncomfortable watch.
                Even though she tried hard to make things work out during filming, the results were less than desirable.
                The director had to spend hours editing and re-shooting certain parts to salvage this disaster of a scene.

                If she were pretty, maybe it wouldn't have been too bad that her comedic timing was non-existent.
                If she were funny, the scene could have been decent despite her face.

                Alas, she was neither.

                She tells a joke. Then she starts to explain it. Then she realizes that she forgot the punchline.
                Repeat this process ten times, and you get the worst attempt at comedy ever recorded.
