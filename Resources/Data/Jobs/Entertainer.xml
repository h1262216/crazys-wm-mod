            She must be the perfect entertainer customers go on and on about her and always come to see her when she works.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="33">
                The heat of her passion and strength of her fierce nature make ${name}'s
                songs absolutely riveting to listen to.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                ${name}'s very appearance in the door of the gambling hall leads to
                applause and the sudden appearance of a clear way to the stage steps.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                You feel inexpressibly proud that ${name}, your daughter, is such a skilled entertainer.

            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                There is no way to resist the raw charisma ${name} practically exudes,
                drawing everybody around her towards her stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Every one of ${name}'s jokes elicits a wave of laughter from the crowd of patrons,
                many of whom have no interest in gambling.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her voice is that of an angel, and her humor is as sharp and cutting as a blade.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Each shift, ${name} ends her show by blowing a kiss to her fans,
                producing waves of applause and cheers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                She could probably excel in any club or entertainment center - fortunately,
                ${name}'s in yours, drawing customers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} is downright ideal for this job.  Her presentation and material are flawless.

        </Message>
        <Message Name="work.great">
            She's unbelievable at this and is always getting praised by the customers for her work.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                The savagery of ${name}'s temper has honed her wit to a razor's edge,
                letting her jab away at the audience and still rake in the tips.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                She cooly paces the edge of the stage as she sings,
                each step deliberate and perfectly poised,
                as if ${name} was some noble pacing her seat of power.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                While her technical skills could use improvement, ${name}'s delivery is beyond reproach.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                ${name} isn't perfect, but she's your own flesh and blood, which is more then close enough.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} begun to acquire her own following -
                a small crowd of people came in just to listen to her and buy drinks.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her jokes are almost always funny as ${name}'s repertoire develops and expands.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s arrival on the stage at the beginning of her shift is greeted by scattered applause
                by the last few gamblers from the previous shift, and the new clients.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s soothing voice seems to glide over the noise and bustling of the gamblers and dealers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Each shift the tips ${name} collects seem to grow in size!

        </Message>
        <Message Name="work.good">
            She's good at this job and gets praised by the customers often.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                Her jokes are a bit more violent than they perhaps should be,
                but the clients seem to like ${name}.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                The elegance ${name} brings to all things enhances her already pleasant singing.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                While ${name}'s repertoire of jokes and other amusements could stand expansion,
                she's got the presentation down pat.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                Though you'll never admit it, you're happy that ${name} has carved out a niche that doesn't
                involve renting her cunt to public servants.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                A couple of gamblers parted with some of their hard-earned
                winnings after swearing that her singing had brought them luck.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} earned a decent tip today for her sincere,
                if not always effective, attempts to entertain the clients.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her singing was pleasing, if bland.  Her voice was nice, if slightly untrained.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Most of the jokes ${name} told were amusing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} managed to provide amusement for anybody who happened to listen to her.

        <Message Name="work.ok">
            She made a few mistakes but overall she is okay at this.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                While ${name}'s jokes tend to fall flat,
                nobody seems to have the bravery to tell her that.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                Her air of sophistication lets ${name} get away with telling boring jokes.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                The tips she received were far more than ${name}'s skills had any reason to bring in.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                ${name} isn't impressive in any way, but she is your daughter,
                so you dutifully clap as she descends from the stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                The slow song ${name} sang at the end of shift really had her full emotion and heart.
                A pity that she felt so bored and tired.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While most of the jokes ${name} tells are old and worn out, a few were rather amusing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} monologued the guests for an hour or so.
                While nobody seemed particularly interested, nobody looked pissed either.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While she won't win any contests, ${name} isn't a terrible singer.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} managed to elicit a few chuckles, and got a few tips.

        <Message Name="work.bad">
            She was nervous and made a few mistakes. She isn't that good at this.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                ${name} cursed the audience roundly for their dislike of her music.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                Even though her jokes were stale and boring,
                the audience couldn't seem to make themselves let ${name} down, and laughed regardless.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                You wonder if your daughter, child of your loins, might do better on her back then on the stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                For all the reaction she's getting, you could probably replace ${name} with a simple mannequin.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} doesn't appear to be enjoying herself, an emotion she has in common with the clientele.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} tells bland jokes and sings forgettable songs.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her singing is barely acceptable,
                but fortunately the bustling of the gambling hall drowns ${name} out for the most part.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While her jokes aren't actually driving anyone off, nobody seems to find her entertaining either.

            She was nervous and constantly making mistakes. She really isn't very good at this job.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                When the crowd booed her,
                ${name} responded by throwing a shoe at one of the loudest and most insulting members.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Fearless" Chance="50">
                Despite the crowd's displeasure, ${name} keeps herself cool and collected,
                apparently unaffected by their ire.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Clumsy" Chance="50">
                ${name} trips and falls flat on her face when climbing up the stage stairs.
                The crowd cheers loudly.

            <Text Condition="Massive Melons|Abnormally Large Boobs|Titanic Tits|Big Boobs|Busty Boobs|Giant Juggs" Chance="33">
                You have a feeling if she wasn't so well-endowed no one would show up for her show.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                The poor quality of her routine was offset by her natural charisma.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                As ${name} butchers another song,
                you feel bitterly ashamed by your relationship to your worthless child.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                You stuck your head into the hall halfway through shift,
                and swore off the gin for the third time this week after hearing ${name}'s horrible singing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                She managed to aggravate several customers with her poor taste in jokes.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s as funny as a peasant uprising and about as appreciated by her audience.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                For some reason, ${name} attempted a dramatic monologue and feigned suicide on stage.
                Needless to say, she didn't receive any tips.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a human body could produce those sounds,
                much less call them "singing".
