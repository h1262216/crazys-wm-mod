                The crew refused to film a Bestiality scene with ${name} because she is not healthy enough.

                As her owner, you over-ruled and gave her consent.
                Your crew readied the cameras, while your men tied her arms behind her back and feet behind her head.
                "Release the beasts!"

            Amused, you have your men flog this slave for a while to remind her of her place.
            You offer the film-crew first choice of your more exotic beasts.

                Given ${name}'s rather 'unenthusiastic' performance, the scene turned out decent enough.

                ${name} is just laying there, totally unresponsive except for a few whimpers and cries.
                Not a good scene.

                As a result of all her struggeling, the beast seriously injured ${name}. The scene turned out rather
                bad.

                While tying her up made it possible to film this scene, the result looks so bad that maybe you should
                have just sent her to the dungeon instead.
