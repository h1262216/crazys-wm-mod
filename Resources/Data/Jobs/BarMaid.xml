                    ${name} responded to one of the vulgar remarks by a client in a much more vulgar way.
                    Needless to say, this didn't earn her any favors with the patrons that shift,
                    and her tips were a bit less than usual.

                    A drunk patron suddenly walked up to ${name} and just started groping her body.
                    Instead of pushing him away immediately,
                    ${name} allowed him to take his time with her tits and butt while she helped herself to his
                    pockets and all the money inside them.
                    The rowdy client left with a dumb glee on his face,
                    probably to find out his fondling was much, much overpriced.

                    When taking an order, ${name} made sure to lean in really close for the client to get a full view of
                    her cleavage. Giving him an eyefull of tits was promptly rewarded with some extra cash in tips.

                    One of the rowdier clients gently slapped the butt of ${name} when she was passing through.
                    Her coy giggle only encouraged more clients to occasionally fondle her butt through the rest of her work,
                    which earned her some extra tips.
