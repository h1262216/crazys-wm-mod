            She must be the perfect stripper - she might be drawing more spectators than the actual fights.

            <Text>${name} throws her bra into the crowd causing a fight to erupt over who got to take it home. They just love her.</Text>
            <Text>People push and shove to get to the front row for ${name}'s intermission dance.</Text>
            <Text>${name} choreographed a martial arts kata that seamlessly removed pieces of clothing between kicks and punches, driving the crowd wild.</Text>
        </Message>

        <Message Name="work.great">
            She's unbelievable at this and is always getting praised by the spectators for her work.

            <Text>${name} throws her bra into the crowd causing an uproar of hooting and screaming. She knows how to drive them crazy.</Text>
            <Text>All male members of ${name}'s audience had trouble standing after she finished her set.</Text>
            <Text>From start to finish, every move ${name} makes practically sweats sexuality.</Text>
        </Message>

        <Message Name="work.good">
            She's good at this job and gets praised by the spectators often.

            <Text>${name}'s sly smile and slow striptease drives the crowd crazy.</Text>
            <Text>You watched with amusement as members of her audience made a disproportionate number of trips to the bathroom after her performance.</Text>
            <Text Updates="Tips+=10">
                Seeing the large crowd waiting eagerly, ${name} smirked and slowly strode out onto the arena floor, knowing she was going get good tips today.

        <Message Name="work.ok">
            She made a few mistakes but overall she is okay at this.

            <Text>While she won't win any contests, ${name} isn't a terrible stripper.</Text>
            <Text>${name} is not the best erotic dancer you've ever seen, but the drunks enjoy the eyecandy.</Text>
            <Text>Somehow, ${name} managed to get a decent amount of tips as she slowly took her clothes of during her intermission show.</Text>
        </Message>

        <Message Name="work.bad">
            She was nervous and made a few mistakes. She isn't that good at this.

            <Text>${name}'s hair got tangled up in her shirt when she tried to take it off, making her reel about the arena floor like a drunk.</Text>
            <Text>For all the reaction she's getting, you could probably replace ${name} with a simple mannequin.</Text>
            <Text>${name} at least managed to get all her clothes off in time before the next bout.</Text>
            <Text>${name} isn't qualified as a stripper, which might explain why she couldn't successfully detach her bra.</Text>
        </Message>

        <Message Name="work.worst">
            ${name} was stiff and nervous, constantly making mistakes. She really isn't good at this job.

            <Text>${name}'s hair got tangled up in her shirt when she tried to take it off, making her reel about the arena floor like a drunk.</Text>
            <Text>Seeing the large crowd waiting, ${name}'s nerve broke, and she wouldn't take the stage.</Text>
            <Text>Somehow, ${name} forgot that she was a stripper and finished her set with her clothes still on.</Text>
            <Text>Somehow, ${name} managed to be so unsexy that the audience barely seemed to notice her presence.</Text>
