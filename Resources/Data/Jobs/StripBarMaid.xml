                ${name} dragged one of the less sober clients outside into a back alley and ordered him to fuck her senseless against a wall.
                After the deed, the poor fellow passed out and ${name} returned to her job as if nothing happened.

                ${name} spotted a relatively good-looking guy walking into the bathroom alone.
                She followed him inside, and as he tried to exit the bathroom stall, he got pushed back in by her.
                ${name} didn't waste any time and in a matter of seconds was vigorously fucking the client.
                After the deed, the client made sure ${name} had a pretty hefty wad of money stuck behind her skirt.
