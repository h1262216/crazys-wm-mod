                ${name} spotted a thief. Luckily, he wasn't a good runner, so even someone as slow as ${name} could

                ${name} spotted a thief. "Stop, you're under arrest", she calls out. The thief takes off, and after a
                rather short chase ${name} is left wheezing, having lost sight of her quarry.
