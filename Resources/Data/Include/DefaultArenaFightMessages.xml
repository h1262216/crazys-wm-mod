            She is immediately brought to the surgery room in the Arena's catacombs, and your Medics start treating
            her wounds. She will need weeks to recover, but the quick medical intervention prevented more serious
            complications.

            She is immediately brought to the surgery room in the Arena's catacombs, but no Medic is available to treat
            her wounds.
