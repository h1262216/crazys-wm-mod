/*!
 * \brief Random selection from a stream of data.
 * \tparam T Type of the selected object.
 * \details This class allows to randomly select an element from a stream of data without knowing beforehand
 * how many elements there will be. This is useful because it allows e.g. to select uniformly from all elements
 * of a list that fulfill a certain criterion without having to build an intermediate container for all elements
 * that fulfil the predicate. In total, this algorithm has O(1) memory and O(N) computational cost instead of
 * O(N) memory O(1) computation as in the case of building a buffer.
 * \note For forward iterators there might be a sometimes more efficient implementation based on iterating the
 * sequence twice. Which algorithm would be more efficient depends on whether the rng or the predicate are more
 * expensive.
