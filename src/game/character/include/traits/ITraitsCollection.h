 * \brief Collection of traits.
 * \details This class manages the traits of a girl. Traits are organised in three lists.
 * The first manages the inborn traits, that are (mostly) immutable, and define which traits will
 * be inherited by children. The second manages traits that are the result of permanent changes to
 * the girl. This may be something learned, or a modification from the clinic. Finally, the third
 * stack manages traits that are only temporary. These are either limited to a fixed amount of time,
 * or tied to an item and removed once the item is removed. These different kinds of traits are handled in
 * the following way:
 * Inherent Traits:
 *   These can be added, removed, and disabled. A disabled inherent trait is dormant, which means that it
 *   can be inherited by a child but are disabled for all other purposes.
 * Permanent Traits:
 *   These can be added, removed, and disabled. A disabled permanent trait is dormant, which can be used e.g. for
 *   overcome drug additions that might be restarted. Permanent traits are not inherent by children. If a permanent
 *   trait is added that excludes an existing permanent trait, this permanent trait is removed. If it excludes an
 *   existing inherent trait, the inherent trait is made dormant. That means that when the permanent trait is removed
 *   again, the inherent trait will not be re-activated automatically. If such behaviour is desired, the trait should be
 *   added as a non-temporary, dynamic trait.
 * Dynamic Traits:
 *   These can be added and removed, but there are no disabled. Dynamic traits might be temporary, which means that
 *   they will automatically be removed after a certain amount of time. Any inherent or permanent trait that is excluded
 *   by a dynamic trait is added to the set of blocked traits. Furthermore, it is possible to add a dynamic trait in an
 *   explicit blocking mode, which means that instead of adding that trait to the active traits, it is added to the
 *   set of blocked traits.
 *
 * Active Traits:
 *   These are the traits that are actually applied. These cannot be set explicitly, but are calculated in `update`
 *   based on inherent, permanent, and dynamic traits. These are all the traits that are neither dormant (not active),
 *   nor in the set of blocked traits.
 *
 * Blocked Traits:
 *   The set of traits that are blocked, i.e. the traits that will not be active. This included all traits that are
 *   explicitly set to blocked by a dynamic trait, and implicitly blocked by the exclusions of dynamical traits. The
 *   difficulty thing to handle is if one dynamical trait blocks another, because the blocked dynamical trait should
 *   not contribute to the blocking list. Therefore, the list of blocked traits is constructed as follows:
 *   The dynamical traits are processed right-to-left (most recently added first). Every trait that is not in the
 *   blocking set is processed. If it is a blocking trait, it is added to the set of blocked traits, otherwise the
 *   traits it excludes are added. The same processing is applied to permanent and inherited traits.
 * TODO should we allow/how to handle asymmetrical exclusion events?
