    /*Escort plans
    General idea is to have her arrive to an appoiment with a client.  If she is to late they may turn her away
    resulting in no money if she is on time it goes to the next part.  Next part is they look her over seeing if
    she looks good enough for them or not and looks at what she is wearing.  Fancy dresses help while something like
    slave rags would hurt and may get her sent away again.  Then they are off to do something like go to dinner, a bar,
    maybe a fancy party what have u.  From there its can she hold his intrest and not embarres him.  Traits play the biggest
    part in this.  An elegant girl would do well for a rich person where a aggressive girl might not. On the other hand
    a deadbeat might be turned off by a elegant girl and prefer something more sleazy or such.  If they pass this part
    it goes to a will they have sex roll.  Sometimes they might be okay with not having sex with the girl and be more then
    happy with just her company other times sex is a must.  Do a roll for the sex type while taking into account what
    types of sex are allowed.  Her skill will determine if the client is happy or not.  Sex would be an extra cost.  The
    further a girl makes it and the happier the client the more she makes.  Deadbeat would be super easy to please where
    a king might be almost impossable to make fully happy without the perfect girl.  Sending a virgin should have different
    things happen if it comes to sex where the girl could accept or not.  Maybe have special things happen if the escort is
    your daughter.*/
